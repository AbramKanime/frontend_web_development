                        <p class="content">After months of learning of couple of programming languages on my own ranging from C, Python, and Javascript, I made a decision to focus and learn front-end web development because I realized that I had more passion for the creativity that comes with it. I then signed up to become a Scrimba student. This is going to cover my journey in this field of web development, and hopefully my story motivates someone out there.</p>

                    <p class="content">Before venturing into the world of Web development, I have a background and career in Finance/Accounting and Data analytics. While in these fields, I was and still very good in what I did, but I did not feel a sense of fulfilment. I have always admired and in awe of the possiblities and creations in the world of tech. It always felt out of reach to me; until I changed my mindset. I have always known my capabilities, and that I am capable of so much more. So, after six years in the world of finance/accounting, I decided to venture into this world of tech. I can attest that this is one of the best decisions I have taken. It is never too late for a change and to pursue your dreams.</p>
                    <p class="content">I love the fact that in this world of tech, everything is possible. It is a world of possibilities. The power to create is in your hands. I am here to make a mark</p>

Responsive design ensures that websites adapt and provide an optimal user experience across a range of devices, from desktops to smartphones and tablets. I learnt how to do this using Flex-box, 'em' and 'rem' units, grid, and so many other concepts</p>
